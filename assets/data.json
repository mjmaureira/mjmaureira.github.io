          "abstract": "We present 3 mm ALMA continuum and line observations at resolutions of 6.5 au and 13 au respectively, toward the Class 0 system IRAS 16293-2422 A. The continuum observations reveal two compact sources towards IRAS 16293-2422 A, coinciding with compact ionized gas emission previously observed at radio wavelengths (A1 and A2), confirming the long-known radio sources as protostellar. Several lines of the J=5-4 rotational transition of HNCO, NH2CHO and t-HCOOH are detected, with which we derived individual line-of-sight velocities. Using these together with the CS (J=2-1), we fit Keplerian profiles towards the individual compact sources and derive masses of the central protostars. The kinematic analysis indicates that A1 and A2 are a bound binary system. Using this new context for the previous 30 years of VLA observations, we fit orbital parameters to the relative motion between A1 and A2 and find the combined protostellar mass derived from the orbit is consistent with the masses derived from the gas kinematics. Both estimations indicate masses consistently higher (0.5<M1<M2<2 Msun) than previous estimations using lower resolution observations of the gas kinematics.",

          "abstract": "We use CARMA 3mm continuum and molecular lines at 1000 au resolution to characterize the structure and kinematics of the envelope surrounding the deeply embedded first core candidate Per-Bolo 58. The line profile of the observed species shows two distinct peaks separated by 0.4-0.6 km/s, most likely arise from two different optically thin velocity components rather than the product of self-absorption in an optically thick line. The two velocity components, each with a mass of 0.5-0.6 Msun, overlap spatially at the position of the continuum emission. We investigate whether these observations are consistent with infall in a turbulent and magnetized envelope. We compare the morphology and spectra of the N2H+(1-0) with synthetic observations of an MHD simulation that considers the collapse of an isolated core that is initially perturbed with a turbulent field. The proposed model matches the data in the production of two velocity components, traced by the isolated hyperfine line of the N2H+(1-0) spectra and shows a general agreement in morphology and velocity field. We also use large maps of the region to compare the kinematics of the core with that of the surrounding large-scale filamentary structure and find that accretion from the large scale-filament could also explain the complex kinematics exhibited by this young dense core.",

          "abstract": "We use 3mm multi-line and continuum CARMA observations towards the first FHSC candidate L1451-mm to characterize the envelope kinematics at 1000 AU scales and investigate its evolutionary state. We detect evidence of infall and rotation in the NH2D, N2H+ and HCN molecular lines. Our data is consistent with an envelope that is both infalling and rotating while conserving angular momentum around a central mass of about 0.06 Msun. We estimated a a mass infall rate of approximately 6e-6 Msun/yr, implying a young age of 1e4 years. Assuming that the accretion onto the central object is the same as the infall rate we obtain that the minimum source size is 1.5-5 AU —consistent with the size expected for a first core. We conclude that L1451-mm is indeed at a very early stage of evolution, either a first core or an extremely young Class 0 protostar. Our results provide strong evidence that L1451-mm is the best candidate for being a bonafide first core.",
